PROJECT TITLE: 2.04 Calcultions Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use integers and decimals with simple calculations.
VERSION or DATE: 11/1/14
AUTHORS: 

PMR

I thought the overall program was easy enough to make. However, I often found myself leaving out a "+" and
I found java giving me errors because of it, and it was generally very particular. Hopefully this 
will change throughout the year as I have more freedom to write code the way I want it.

In the future: I would make sure to double check everything before compiling.
