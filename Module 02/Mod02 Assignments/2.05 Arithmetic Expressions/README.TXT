I thought this section was much easier than the one before. Now that I understand how to properly format my code, everything was a lot easier.
I also used a different program, called Geany, which I like a lot better than BlueJ, although I still use it to actually run and compile it. BlueJ just felt kind of clunky to me, while Geany is more like a simple text editor.

I can't wait to get started on some harder stuff!
