1. Explain in your own words the relationship between a deck and a card.
	A deck creates an arraylist of card objects.
2. Consider the deck initialized with the statements below. How many cards does the deck contain?
 String[] ranks = {"jack", "queen", "king"};
 String[] suits = {"blue", "red"};
 int[] pointValues = {11, 12, 13};
 Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);
	It contains 5 cards.
3. The game of Twenty-One is played with a deck of 52 cards. Ranks run from ace (highest) down to 2
(lowest). Suits are spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs as in many other games. A face card has point
value 10; an ace has point value 11; point values for 2, …, 10 are 2, …, 10, respectively. Specify the
contents of the ranks, suits, and pointValues arrays so that the statement
 Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);
initializes a deck for a Twenty-One game.
	The array rank would have 4 of each card (ace, jack, etc). Suits would have 13 of each of the four suits. 
	The total length of the array would be 51.
4. Does the order of elements of the ranks, suits, and pointValues arrays matter? 
	Yes. The order determines the card.
